            <h1>About </h1>
            <p>I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating innovative solutions to complex problems. With a
                strong background in computer science and years of experience in the industry, I specialize in
                developing web applications, mobile apps, and software systems that are both user-friendly and
                efficient.</p>
            <p>My expertise includes proficiency in various programming languages such as JavaScript, Python, and
                Java, as well as frameworks like React, Angular, and Django. I am also well-versed in database
                management, cloud computing, and DevOps practices.</p>
            <p>In addition to my technical skills, I am a collaborative team player who thrives in dynamic
                environments. I enjoy working closely with cross-functional teams to deliver high-quality products
                that meet user needs and business goals.</p>
            <p>When I'm not coding, I enjoy staying up-to-date with the latest industry trends, contributing to
                open-source projects, and mentoring aspiring developers. I am always eager to learn new technologies
